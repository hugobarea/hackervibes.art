# Local Privilege Escalation via MSI installer
## Affected product: PDF24 Creator <= 11.15.1
*CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H*

Personally decided to bring this one because I found the exploitation process to be quite cool.

This vulnerability consists in the setting of an OpLock in order to freeze a cmd.exe windows that is created by the 'Repair' function of the MSI (un)installer. This leads to a browser window that is executed with SYSTEM privileges, allowing an attacker to open any process with high integrity. Obviously, we'll go for cmd.exe ;)
